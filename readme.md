Create an app that displays all 6 main movies and shows the title and opening crawl for each one.

After that create a "show people" button under each opening crawl that grabs the 3 first characters in the film and displays their names in the people div.

Stretch:
Refactor the page using materialize to make it look better.
Have the show people button open a modal that displays the actors.
Create another button to show the names of the planets the movie took place on.
